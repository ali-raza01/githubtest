Throughout his life, Abu Bakr remained a friend and confidante of Muhammad. Upon Muhammad's death he became the first Muslim ruler, regarded as the first of the Rashidun (righteously guided Caliphs). His caliphate lasted two years and three months, during which time he consolidated the Muslim state. Upon the death of Muhammad, some tribes rebelled, and in return he fought the Ridda wars against these Arab tribes to establish Islamic rule over all of Arabia. He also conquered the lands of Syria and Iraq.\n<br>\n<h3>Abu Bakr as-Siddique</h3>Abu Bakr was the Prophet’s (ﷺ) best friend, and the first rightly-guided Caliph.  He was the only person, other than the Prophet’s wife (Khadijah), who accepted Islam immediately and believed in Muhammad from Islam’s earliest beginnings. Abu Bakr always remained at the Prophet’s side, and he had no reservations about spending his wealth for the sake of Islam and the Muslims. He belonged to a wealthy, well-established family in Mecca, but when he died he had only six hundred dirhams. He used his status in Mecca to protect new converts to Islam when the Quraish were oppressing Muslims. The Companions recognized his superiority, yet he always remained humble and sincere towards all.  He is an example of dedication and sacrifice.\n",

   "briefbio": "Umar Bin Al-Khattab(R) was among the nobles of the Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) give him the title of Farooq. His parents were Khattab ibn Nufayl and Hantamah bint Hisham Makhzumi. They had 3 children, 2 boys and 1 girl. Their names are Umar bin Al-Khattab(R), Zaid bint al-Khattab(R), and Fatima bint al-Khattab(R).<br>\n\nUmar Bin Al-Khattab (R) was known to be one of the strongest and most fearless men, before and after he embraced Islam. Umar Bin Al-Khattab (R) was educated and knowledgeable. He had learned to read and write while still a child, which was a very rare thing in Makkah at the time.\n<br>\nIn the beginning of Prophet hood, Muslims were few and weak. Allah guided Umar Bin Al-Khattab (R) to serve Islam. Umar Bin Al-Khattab (R) was a great pillar of strength for Islam. Umar bin Al-Khattab had great virtue. Umar Bin Al-Khattab(R) was also very pious and sincere. He used to cry during his salah!! On one occasion the Prophet  (ﷺ) said to Umar (R) “By Allah, Satan will never tread the way you pass through”.\n<br>\nUmar Bin Al-Khattab(R) was the 2nd Khaleefah of Islam, after Abu Bakr (R). Umar Bin Al-Khattab(R) spent many nights going around the streets of Madina to see whether anyone needed help. He gave needy people some food to eat so no one slept hungry. \n<br>\nUmar Bin Al-Khattab(R) was fair, strong and righteous during his years as a Khaleefah. The great powers of Roman and Persian Empires were defeated during the decade long Caliphate. The conquest include Persia, Iraq, Jazirah, Khurasan, Baluchistan, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Armenia.\n<br>\nHe was 63 years old when he died. He was buried next to Muhammad (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr(R) in Masjid Nabawi. He was given the glad tiding of Jannah. \n<br>\n<h3>Umar Ibn Al-Khattab</h3> ‘Umar was the second Caliph of Islam and one of the closest Companions to the Prophet (ﷺ). He was so firm in his practice of Islam that he usually could sense what was right or wrong before the Prophet (ﷺ) had informed others of it.  He used to say to his friends:  “If a mule stumbles near the Euphrates River, I fear being questioned by Allah as to why I had not paved the road for it.”  ‘Umar is the greatest examples of a just ruler.  Before he converted, ‘Umar was a bitter enemy of Islam, but when he entered the fold, the Muslims felt strong enough to withstand any oppression, and began worshipping Allah openly. The Prophet (ﷺ) said of ‘Umar:  “Among the Children of Israel who lived before you, there were men who used to be inspired with guidance though they were not Prophets, and if there were any such person amongst my followers, it would be ‘Umar.”",

An example of that is what he did at the prophet's era, as we said of late. Likewise, his caliphate was giving, solidarity and relief.<br>\nIn the following subject of research we will deal with two features:<br>First : His concern for and relief of his subjects. Second : Situations of concern for and relief of the poor at his era. The first feature: his concern for and relief of his subject: 'Uthman, May Allah be pleased with him, followed the steps of his rightly guided predecessor caliphs in terms of concern for the subject and solidarity with the poor and the needy. He raised the portion of charity which Omar allocated from the House of Charity, taking the individual portion of charity up to one hundred. He also raised the Ramadan portion of charity by one more dirham for each individual in society, and by two dirhams for the Mothers of the Believers. He also, May Allah be pleased with him, allocated Semat in the Prophet's mosque which served as an accommodation to those devoted worshippers or those who were in I'tikaf( seclusion in the mosque), as well as the wayfarers, the poor and the needy. Othman was a generous man who gave the poor Muslims out of his own money if there was not money left in the House of Charity. Al Hassan Al Basry describes how abundant charity which was handed out to the needy in his era, saying I saw a Othman' s caller announce\" Oh People, come along to get your portion of charity, of substances, of clothing\", and he even called on the people to come to take butter and honey<br>Second: Situations of solidarity with and relief of the poor at his era: The people enjoyed much bounty in the caliphate of Othman, May Allah be Pleased with him, which covered all brackets of society. Mubarak Ibn Fudalah the Mawla of Zaid Ibn el Khattab, said\" I heard Othman addressing the people and saying \"Oh people, I wonder at your resentment while you live in daily bounty and high standard of living. These words said by Othman are evidence that there was a sense of solidarity on the part of the whole society among its individuals. It is related that when Talha Ibn Obaid Allah, May Allah be pleased with him, received money from Hadhramaut, estimated at about 700000 dirhams, he spent his night feeling uneasy. When his wife asked him what wrong was, he told her that \"I donâ€™t know the magnitude of Allah's punishment with this money in my home\". Hearing this, she, Um kulthoum bint Al Seddik, suggested him to\" think of some of your Muslim people and in the morning you can divide the money between them.\", she said. He hailed her opinion and in the morning he ordered pots to be filled with money and divide them among the Muhajerren and the Ansar.<br>\nIt was also related that he extended his charity to Bani Tameem tribe when funds came to him from Iraq, estimated at 400000 to 500000, so much so that his charity outreached all impoverished families in this tribe, with Othman catering for them and helping their men to get married. He even paid back their debts; he paid back the debt due on Subaiha el Tameemy which reached 30000 dirhams.\"",

   "briefbio": "Alī was the only person born in the Kaaba sanctuary in Mecca, the holiest place in Islam. His father was Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (Quraishi) and his mother was Fatima bint Asad but he was raised in the household of Muhammad, who himself was raised by Abu Talib, Muhammad's uncle. When Muhammad reported receiving a divine revelation, ʿAlī was among the first to accept his message, dedicating his life to the cause of Islam.<br>\nThe era of Ali Ibn Abu Taleb, May Allah be pleased with him, witnessed several political crises which plagued the Muslim society. But as it was a great and well structured society built up by the Messenger of Allah, SAWA, it didn’t collapse but it remained intact, with its individuals being coherent and cooperative. Following are examples of solidarity and adhesion of the society at this era. We in this subject of research deal with two features: <br><br>First: His concern for and relief of his subjects Second: Examples of the above mentioned<br>First: His concern for and relief of his subjects Although he was the Caliph of the Muslims, Imam Ali, May Allah be pleased with him, was in the habit of frequenting the markets of Koofa, guiding the misguided and helping the meek. He might even meet the old, carrying their effects. Sometimes his closest aides felt awkward at this and wondering how the Caliph of the Believers did so. But he reminded them of ayahs in the Qu'ran in which Allah said That is the Last Home. We make it for the ones who would not like exaltation in the earth nor corruption, and the (fortunate) End is for the pious. Out of his conviction of the necessity to set an example for Muslims, he donated a plot of land in Yanbo area, which he was allotted by Omar Ibn Al Khattab, May Allah be pleased with him. While he was digging a well in this area, his workers were surprised at a huge fountain of water as thick as a camel's neck. After they ended digging and the well abounded with water, Ali decided to donate it for the poor and the needy for the cause of Allah. In his will he wrote: This is what Ali Ibn Abu Taleb willed as part of his legacy: I donated Yanbo, Wadi Al Kora, Azneya and Ra'a, seeking Allah's Grace and His Good Pleasure. I will that this charity be used for the interest of all Muslims both at war and in peace , on soldiers, remote and close relatives, and these plots of land shall not be floated for sale or gifted to specific persons to the exclusion of others, nor shall they be inherited either in my life or after. In doing this, I only seek the Good Pleasure of Allah and the Paradise in the Hereafter, hoping that He accept this donation from me as He is the Best of the Interstaters. As Ibn Kathir related that a man came to Ali Ibn Taleb, May Allah be pleased with him, and said: Oh, Emir of the Believers, I need a favor from you, but I prayed to Allah before I asked you, so if you do me this favor, then I will thank Allah and thank you, otherwise I will thank Allah and excuse you. \"Write what you need on the ground as I hate to see humiliation of begging on your face\", Ali said. So the man wrote on the ground\" I need clothing\". Ali then ordered new clothes for the man. The man took the new clothes and improvised a poem in which he thanked Imam Ali, May Allah be pleased with him, and prayed that Allah reward him clothes in the Paradise. The man in his poem also called on all people to do favor, citing the notion \"one good turn deserves another \". Admired at his reply and his poem, Imam Ali ordered one of his aides to bring him one hundred dinars and he gave it to the man. Seeing this, Al Asbagh, one of the people who witnessed the incident, wondered \" Oh, Emir of the Believers, clothes and one hundred dinars?!!\" \" Yes,\" Ali said, citing the prophet, SAWA, as ordaining to \"appreciate the people at their real worth\" and I see this man is worth this\", Ali said. This above mentioned situation illustrates the social conscience of the Emir of Believers Ali Ibn Abu Taleb, May Allah be pleased with him, as he felt for the needy, catered for their needs and considered their feelings. An example of his justice and his sound and right policy concerning the funds of the Nation is that he considered any money coming to the House of Charity as purely for the poor and the needy and for catering of the needy, with the aim to curb poverty so that the Nation lead a decent life. So he adopted his right guided policy which provided that \"Allah imposed amounts of money taken from the rich to the poor, as poverty emerges with the extravagance of the rich!\". He went on distributing handouts to the poor and the needy until he had nothing left. Once he, May Allah be pleased with him, received funds, he only divided all of them until late in the day. One day his caller Amer Ibn Al Nabbah said to him: Oh, Emir of the Believers, the House of Charity now bustles with gold and silver.\" Allah is Great\", he said and he accompanied Ibn Al Nabbah to the House of Charity, saying \"Oh, Ibn Al Nabbah, bring me the poor of the Koofa. Ibn el Nabbah related that people were called and given all that was in the House of Charity, while Ali was repeating and addressing \"I will not allow the worldly desires to drag my leg, and will pursue my charity and donations until I spend all dinars and dirhams on the poor and the needy Second Feature: Further Examples in His Era Not only did Imam Ali pursue his generosity and favor deeds, but he also brought up his children to giving and charity for the needy and the poor. It was related by Imam Ali, May Allah be pleased with him, that he addressed the people saying, \"Al Hassan- his son- raised funds and he would like to divide it among you. When the people came, Al Hassan stood up and said \"I only raised it for the poor\". On saying this, half of the people stood up. All the forms of charity and relief which we quoted from the era of the rightly guided caliphs do illustrate that this principle took root within the society which was brought up at the hands of the prophet, SAWA. The society individuals also adhered to Islam and its principles, thus dominating the world, giving a lesson that the reform of individuals is indispensable for the reform of society. It means that the fragile and badly structured individuals cannot make up a powerful society.\"",

   "briefbio": "The eighth person to embrace Islam, he migrated twice to Abyssinia. He was one of the ten persons (al-asharatu-l mubashshirin) who were assured of entering Paradise. He was one of the six persons chosen by Umar to form the council of shura to choose the Khalifah after his death. His name in Jahiliyyah days was Abu Amr. But when he accepted Islam the noble Prophet called him Abdur-Rahman - the servant of the Beneficent God.\n Abdur-Rahman distinguished himself in both the battles of Badr and Uhud, suffering more than twenty wounds at the latter.  Starting with nothing, he went on to enjoy tremendous success as a merchant, becoming the richest of the Companions.  From his great wealth,  Abdur-Rahman financed the Muslim armies, contributed to the the upkeep of the family of Mohammed after the prophet's death and was universally renowned for his fabulous generosity.\n<br>\nHis name was ’Abdul-Rahman bin ’Awf bin Abdul-Harith bin Zuhrah. His nickname was Abu \n\nMuhammad. The Companion ‘Abdul-Rahman bin ‘Awf (R) is one of those whom Allah’s Messenger\n\n(SAW) bestowed the glad tidings of Paradise. He was an early convert. He did not conceal\n\nreversion and didn’t hesitate due to fear of persecution. ‘Abdul-Rahman bin ‘Awf was one of the\n\nelite and chosen Companions as regards to truthfulness of belief, sincerity of the creed, fighting in\n\nthe way of Allah and spending for the sake of Him. He was a religious scholar, and the\n\nCompanions (R) used to believe what he narrated from Allah’s Messenger (SAW). He had a\n\nprofound religious knowledge and was a gifted teacher. He feared Allah much, even though he\n\nwas one of the ten who was given the glad tidings of Paradise. He was present in all the battles. \n\nOn the day of Uhud, when the Muslims fled except a few warriors, he was among those who \n\nremained to defend Allah’s Messenger (SAW). He was generous and openhanded without \n\nworrying about poverty. Even a verse was revealed for him(Al-Baqarah 2:262). He earned his \n\nwealth as a trader. He supported the Mothers of the believers a lot. Once Aisha (R) said: “May \n\nAllah the Almighty give ‘Abdul-Rahman bin ‘Awf from the sweet waters of Salsabil in Paradise.” His \n\nwealth increased due to the fact that: “Giving charity purifies, and augments the wealth of the \n\ngiver.” He used to rely on Allah first, and then his own efforts. Muhammad (SAW) said that he was \n\none of the most excellent Muslims. ‘Abdul-Rahman bin ‘Awf was one of the most dutiful to the \n\nMothers of the believers after the death of Allah’s Messenger (SAW). Allah’s Messenger (SAW) \n\nperformed the prayer behind him. None acquired such a glorious deed except he and Abu Bakr. \n\nCompanions of Muhammad (SAW) confessed he was virtuous and excellent in behavior. ‘Abdul-\n\nRahman bin ‘Awf (R) died in the 31st year A.H. at the age of 72. He was buried in Al-Baqi’.<br>\n \nThe Brotherhood was made b/w him and Sa'd bin al-Rabi'.",

   "briefbio": "Sa`ad ibn Abī Waqqās (R) was an early convert to Islam and one of the important companions of Muhammad (ﷺ). He was born in 39 BH in makkah. He was from the Banū Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe. His parents were Malik bin Uhaib and Hamnah bint Sufyan bin Ummaya.\n<br>\nHe was the first one to shoot an arrow in the cause of Allah. He fought in the battle of Badr with his young brother Umayr, who cried to accompany the Muslim army, as he was only in his early teens. Sa`d returned to al-Madīnah alone; Umayr was one of the fourteen Muslims who martyred in the battle.\n<br>\nAt the battle of Uhud, Sa`d(R)  was among those who fought in defense of Muhammad after some Muslims had deserted their positions. One night after the battle the prophet could not sleep and was in fear of something.He wanted someone to guard him. Then Sa’d(R) came and said :” I sense fear in you so I will protect you.” So the Prophet made duaa for him and slept peacefully.\n<br>\nOne story I would like to share is about how steadfast he was to islam.  He was the 3rd to accept isalm, but his mother applied EXTREME pressure on him to not accept islam. She wanted him to follow the religion of the forefathers. When he did NOT obey her, she vowed not to eat or drink anything until he submitts to her. She did not eat or drink anything for many days and fainted 3 times, BUT he as not prepared to foresake islam.\n<br>\nSa`d(R)  also fought under `Umar's command against the Sāsānian army in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. He was later appointed governor of al-Kūfah and Najd during the caliphate of `Umar. Iraq and Fars (Iran) was conquered under his command.\n<br>\nHe died in 55 AH in Medina at the time of Amir Mu’awiyah (RA). His body was brought to Medinah and he was buried in Jannat-ul-baq’ee. He was the last of the Asharrah Mubasharah to die.\n",
